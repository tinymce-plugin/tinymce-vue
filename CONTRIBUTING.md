This project follows the [beehive-flow](https://github.com/tinymce/beehive-flow/) branching process ("Basic process - release from main branch").
Please read the [beehive-flow readme](https://github.com/tinymce/beehive-flow/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
This mainly affects branching and merging for Tiny staff. 

External contributors are free to submit PRs against the `main` branch. 
Note that contributions will require signing of our Contributor License Agreement.
